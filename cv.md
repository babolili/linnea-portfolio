## What i do 

### Things I do (not necessarily in order):  

- Talk to users and clients and environments to find problems
- Examine problems to see if/how they could/need to be be solved.
- Help create, nurture & explore new ideas through concept development
- Test hypotheses through prototyping & user tests (Even better if I get to do a sprint!! yaaay!!!)
- Define user stories and plan how we'll design and build eventual products (Spreadsheets all the way. Seriously.)
- Sketch wireframes for said products (Grey pens are worth their weight in gold. Trust me.)
- Try to create and document design systems according to atomic design principles. (It's pretty hard though.)
- Create documentation for (booo) or collaborate with (yaay) developers for the build phase 
- Have loads of design reviews with my fellow designers
-Lead workshops with people of all ages and professions
- Explore, test, and extend knowledge of new and old methodologies and processes. 

### Things I can't do
- Branding and visual design (I know what I think looks good, but I don't know how to do that for other people)
- Production ready code - I'm pretty good at markup and sass (if I may say so myself) but plugging anything into a backend is a  mystery to me. Frontend isn't my main jam, but I love getting to build stuff for prototypes, and working with Web developers. 
- Skateboard (zero balance)

### A selection of tools I like: 
- Dropbox & Dropbox paper 
- Google sheets 
- Sketch 
- Invision 
- Principle 
- Photoshop, illustrator, premiere,
- Keynote 
- Slack 
- Google Inbox 
- Instagram & Later
