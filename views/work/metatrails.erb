I designed Metatrails as part of an internal teambuilding exercise that focused on creating an out of the ordinary web application. Metatrails was an experiment in creating alternative user experiences with an unusual interface, using Thoughtbot’s open source learning resource “Trails” as a starting point for the product. While I did not build the application itself, I designed and built the landing page.
