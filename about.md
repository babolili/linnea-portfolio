	<h1>Who I am</h1>
	<p>
		I'm half Swedish and half Chinese, and spent my life moving between <em>Stockholm</em>, <em>Shanghai</em> and <em>London</em>. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Design from Goldsmiths, University of London. Since 2013 I've worked mainly in agencies like <a href="">Serious Fox</a> and <a href="">Apegroup</a>, but also as a freelancer. I was also briefly a cofounder in a <em>startup</em>
	</p>

		I've always worked at agencies because I've heard the work is more varied and fast-paced, but if you're a product company who can prove me wrong, tell me how! I hate not having enough to do. My least favourite part of a project is the nitpicking details at the end. My favourite is coming up with ideas (obv) but also doing hands on stuff and prototyping in context. I like to think that I I learn fast, but honestly, who doesn't? My <a href="">articles</a> will tell you more about how I work. You can hear what I sound like in <a href="">Sweden's only podcast about digital design</a>.

		I've been told I come across as shy flower in the beginning and then everyone realises I'm loud, opinionated & stubborn when it's already too late to escape. I'm way funnier in English than Swedish. I prefer working together with people, but when I need to concentrate I turn into a headphone hermit. I think it's important to do some fun stuff with your team, preferably with beers and even more preferably if they happen to be some exciting IPAs ;)

		I have millennial level instagram skills. I do <em>yoga almost every day</em>. I've <a href="">self published a book about cooking</a>. I draw random historical costumes when I have time. I got weirdly good at making polygonal animal illustrations. I embroider about 1 tote bag a year. I painted a while but please don't confuse me with the super talented/famous painter with the exact same name as me. I have a healthy obsession with squishy faced animals.
